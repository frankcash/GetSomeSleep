# Slothy
Sleep or never post to social media again!

# About
Slothy is a chrome extension that connects to the FitBit API and checks your daily goal for steps.  If you haven't achieved your goals you won't be able to post to chrome!

Slothy also includes an API server.  This server can be used to make API calls from other sources.  Such as from git (to prevent commiting before x amount of steps!).
